#### Branch Protection Rules

The `main` branch is protected with the following rules:

- ‚úÖ **Require pull requests** - No direct commits allowed
- ‚úÖ **Require fork** - PRs must come from forks, not branches
- ‚úÖ **Squash merging only** - Keeps history clean
- ‚úÖ **Delete branch after merge** - Automatic cleanup

This ensures all changes are reviewed and the commit history stays clean.
