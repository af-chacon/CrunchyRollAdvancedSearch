Natsuki Ikaruga, a boy who lost his mother and one of his legs in an accident some years earlier, returns disillusioned from a harsh life in the big city to find his old countryside home half-swallowed by the sea. Left without a family, all he has to his name is the ship and submarine left to him by his oceanologist grandmother, and her debts. His only hope to restore the dreams for the future that he has lost is to take up an opportunity presented to him by the suspicious debt collector Catherine. They set sail to search the sunken ruins of his grandmother's laboratory in order to find a treasure rumor says she left there. But what they find is not riches or jewels; it is a strange girl lying asleep in a coffin at the bottom of the sea, Atri. Atri is a robot, but her appearance and her wealth of emotions would fool anyone into think she's a living, breathing human being. In gratitude for being salvaged, she makes a declaration to Natsuki. \"I want to fulfil my master's final order. Until I do, I'll be your leg!\" In a little town slowly being enveloped by the ocean, an unforgettable summer is about to begin for this boy and this mysterious robot girl...",

    "description": "Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin) is a groundbreaking action anime series with elements of drama, horror, and anime featuring intense storytelling, brutal battles, and deep philosophical themes. Humanity survives behind massive walls against man-eating Titans. After a Colossal Titan destroys his home and kills his mother, Eren Jaeger joins the Scout Regiment with his friends, Mikasa and Armin, only to discover he can transform into a Titan himself. As Eren fights for humanity’s survival, he uncovers dark conspiracies, political intrigue, and the terrifying origins of the Titans.\r\n\r\nThe series features a complex ensemble of characters, each playing a pivotal role in humanity’s struggle for survival. The arcs of Eren Jaeger, Mikasa Ackermann, Armin Arlelt, and more explore themes of trauma, ideology, and the cyclical nature of violence, making Attack on Titan as much a psychological drama as an action epic.\r\n\r\nAttack on Titan spans four seasons and premiered in April 2013, with the first three seasons all animated by Wit Studio. Attack on Titan Final Season, produced by MAPPA, was split into multiple parts from December 2020 to November 2023. The last two specials, Attack on Titan Final Season THE FINAL CHAPTERS, were later edited together into one epic finale film titled Attack on Titan: THE LAST ATTACK.",

    "description": "\"Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End is an anime adaptation of a manga series released in September 2023. This fantasy begins as heroes disband following a quest to defeat the Demon King. As decades pass, the elf mage Frieren attends a comrade’s funeral and learns new things about her old companions. This anime blends fantasy, reflection, and insightful character developments with themes of friendship and mortality.\r\n\r\nAcross the 28-episode series, we follow Frieren, her apprentice Fern, and a warrior named Stark. As they travel through lands the hero party had fought to save, Frieren works to fulfill the last wishes of her former companions. Along their journey, Frieren begins to discover what it means to truly live and connect with others.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Fern and Stark, flashbacks introduce Himmel, Heiter, Eisen, and others from Frieren’s past. Getting to know these characters deepens the story’s emotional weight, and contrasts Frieren’s elf life and the lives of her companions.\r\n\r\nThe anime is produced by the MADHOUSE animation studio, known for their work on Death Note, One-Punch Man, and Hunter x Hunter. The screenplay was written by Tomohiro Suzuki, who previously wrote on One-Punch Man. A beloved anime, Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End garnered 7 wins at the 2023 Anime Trending Awards, 5 wins and 15 nominations at the 2025 Anime Trending Awards, and 4 wins and 16 nominations at the 2025 Crunchyroll Anime Awards. \"",

While readers initially drew connections between Kaiju No. 8 and series like Attack on Titan, Chainsaw Man, and One-Punch Man, fans soon fell in love with its unique elements, art style, and protagonist. The manga quickly became a global sensation. In the first six months, over 550,000 copies were in circulation. By March 2023, over 11 million copies were in circulation. When the Production I.G animation studio announced they were developing an anime series under the supervision of Studio khara, fans anxiously awaited to see the series adapted for the screen. \r\n\r\nThe story revolves around Kafka Hibino, a 32-year-old longing to join The Defense Force and make good on his promise to a childhood friend, Mina Ashiro. He befriends a new coworker Reno Ichikawa, while cleaning up Kaiju remains, whose determination to join The Defense Force inspires Kafka to fulfill his childhood promise to pass the entrance exam and join Mina to protect humanity. When a small Kaiju burrows itself inside Kafka, he gains superhuman strength and powers fit for fighting Kaiju. He works to earn the trust of his human teammates, defeat increasingly powerful Kaiju, and keep the world safe.",

    "description": "My Hero Academia (Boku no Hero Academia) is a popular anime series that blends action, heartfelt storytelling, and the personal growth of youths within a vibrant superhero world.\r\nThe story follows Izuku Midoriya, a boy born without a superpowered “Quirk” in a world where 80% of the population has them. Despite this, Izuku dreams of becoming the greatest hero like his idol, All Might.\r\nAfter he unexpectedly inherits All Might’s “Quirk,” Izuku enrolls at U.A. High School, a prestigious hero academy. There, Izuku trains alongside friends including his childhood friend-turned-rival Katsuki Bakugo, Shoto Todoroki who possesses both great intelligence and physical strength, Ochaco Uraraka, and Tenya Iida. Together, Izuku and his classmates must grow stronger while exploring the harsh reality behind what it truly means to be a hero.\r\n\r\nWhile early seasons of My Hero Academia focus on friendship, growth, and the excitement of pursuing dreams, the later half of the series not only shows the intensifying battles, but also explores darker themes of sacrifice, loss, and the moral complexities of heroism.\r\n\r\nMy Hero Academia has released seven seasons so far, with a new season airing nearly every year. The first three seasons aired in consecutive Aprils from 2016 to 2018, followed by Seasons 4 through 8 releasing between late 2019 and late 2025. The series is co-produced and animated by BONES FILM, with direction from Kenji Nagasaki, Masahiro Mukai, and Naomi Nakayama.",

She's actually an alien sent by the Galaxy Federation to observe the Earth! As the sole human being with knowledge of Ms. Kazumi's secret, Kei must... marry her?! Homework, dating, and a gorgeous wife - going to school has never been quite this fun!",

The story follows Sung Jinwoo, the world’s weakest hunter, who was chosen by the mysterious “system” after barely surviving a deadly dungeon raid. The system allows him to level up beyond human limits, turning him from prey to predator as he uncovers the dark truth behind the monster-infested dungeons.\r\n\r\nThe first season (12 episodes) premiered January 7, 2024, chronicling Jinwoo’s transformation from helpless E-rank hunter to an unstoppable force. Solo Leveling Season 2 -Arise from the Shadow- (13 episodes) escalates the stakes as Jinwoo masters his necromancer abilities, commanding an army of shadows while hiding his true power from fellow hunters. His ultimate mission: to save his mother and secure his family’s future.\r\n\r\nDirected by Shunsuke Nakashige with a powerhouse score by Hiroyuki SAWANO, the anime brings the webtoon’s iconic action to life. With its addictive progression system, jaw-dropping battles, and shadowy conspiracies, Solo Leveling has become a global phenomenon for fans of dark fantasy and action-packed shounen. ",

The latest masterpiece from Makoto Shinkai, the award-winning director of Weathering With You and Your Name, is a profound coming-of-age film that explores connection and holding space for the past.\r\n\r\nWhen high schooler Suzume Iwato runs into mysterious and devastatingly handsome out-of-towner Souta, her whole world changes. Intrigued with what he’s up to, she discovers an abandoned building with a mysterious door holding a dark supernatural force inside it. To her surprise, these mystical entrances are opening across Japan, in more of its long-forgotten regions. Able to see the supernatural forces that others can’t, she teams up with Souta to save Japan by finding the doors and closing them. Before long, doors open one after another across Japan. Guided by the mysterious doors and Daijin, Suzume’s journey to lock the doors leads her across the country’s islands. What awaits on her mission is unexpected help in the form of a forgotten truth.\r\n\r\nThe movie features Shinkai’s signature visual style of vibrant colors and natural splendor.

Then, in a passing glance, his attention is captured by the wild, animal-like movements of a student on the school's athletic field.

As he watches Akira running in a rough, unrefined gait, Riku gives him a bit of advice without thinking, and those words end up setting his passion for rugby alight again.",
